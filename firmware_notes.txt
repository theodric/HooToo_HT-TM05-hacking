Unstructured notes about how the firmware is built

/proc/vs_battery_quantity stores the current battery%

If you run shutdown/poweroff/reboot from inside the shell, your device will reset to factory defaults! Don't do this. Maybe I should hack around it.

etc is synced to the mtd7 partition at shutdown (using power button). That means you can create an /etc/root and have a writable $home for root using the mountroot-noentwhere script but you need to be careful not to exceed the capacity of the MTD.


Deviations from HooToo stock firmware include:

SSH server (dropbear) and telnet server

The entware/optware system that runs off a USB stick: see /etc/entware-env.sh
Install entware-ng which works with 2.6.36 kernels by downloading and executing http://pkg.entware.net/binaries/mipsel/installer/installer.sh
Possibly of interest...? https://www.snbforums.com/threads/mips-entware-backports-repo-entware-ng-reloaded.49468/

e2fsck.static which should be kept on the USB stick

/etc/init.d/mount_external_loopfs.sh and /etc/init.d/mountroot-noentwhere
